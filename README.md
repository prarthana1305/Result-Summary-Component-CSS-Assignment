# Result Summary Component

## Overview

This project consists of a `Result Summary Component` that displays test results in a user-friendly UI, designed with HTML and styled using CSS. The component is responsive, providing a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. 

## Approach

The design features two main sections:

1. **Result Section**: 
   - Displays the overall score with a score circle and a brief text message to indicate how the user performed.
   - The score is presented in a circular animated style that grows and shrinks to create a pulse effect.
   - The result section has a gradient background to enhance the visual appeal.

2. **Summary Section**:
   - Provides a detailed breakdown of the test metrics such as Reaction, Memory, Verbal, and Visual scores.
   - These metrics are displayed in individual boxes with different colors for each category.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is mobile-friendly, using media queries to adjust the component's appearance on smaller screens.
- **Animations**: Animated effects like pulse and slide-up make the UI visually engaging.
- **CSS Variables**: Color schemes and gradient settings are managed through CSS custom properties (`:root`), ensuring easy customization.
- **Flexbox & Grid**: Flexbox is used for general layout, while CSS Grid is used to organize the summary section into a neat, flexible grid layout.
